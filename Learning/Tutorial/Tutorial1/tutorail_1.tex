This is my first LaTex document. \\ 
Suppose we are given a rectangle with side length $(x+1) $ and $(x+3)$. Then the equation $A = x^2+4x+3 $ represents the area of the rectangle.

Note: If we use '\$' then math equations are shown on same line whereas use of '\$\$' results in math equation in new line.
